1. Project Overview
Briefly explain the purpose of the repository.
For example, "This repository provides tools and models for forecasting municipal waste demand using time-series data, enabling better planning and waste management."
2. Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Combines raw data, processes it, and aggregates it into weekly and seasonal datasets.
Model Training: Implements a TimeSeriesTransformer model for time-series forecasting.
Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualization: Provides visualizations for weekly and seasonal waste volumes.
3. Technical Details
Programming Language: Python (100%).
Key Dependencies:
pandas, numpy, torch, scikit-learn, joblib, streamlit, plotly, etc.
4. Repository Structure
src/preprocessing.py: Handles data preprocessing and aggregation.
src/model_training.py: Defines and trains the forecasting model.
src/evaluation.py: Evaluates the trained model.
src/visualization_proofs.py: Generates visualizations.
dashboard/app.py: Streamlit-based web dashboard for visualization and interaction.
5. How to Use
Installation: Provide a step-by-step guide to install dependencies and set up the environment.
Data Preparation: Instructions for placing raw data in the data/raw directory.
Running the Project:
Preprocess data using src/preprocessing.py.
Train the model using src/model_training.py.
Evaluate the model using src/evaluation.py.
Visualize results using src/visualization_proofs.py.
Launch Dashboard: Use dashboard/app.py to launch the web dashboard.
6. Future Work
Include details about adding forecasting functionality in the dashboard.
